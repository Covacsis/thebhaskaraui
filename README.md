# the bhaskara ui

The idea is to provide few simple UI tools.

## MakeComponent

this can create a component.

code is very small so one can go through it to understand what it does.

for now see test.html for an example

## todos
-make more required binders
-make it independent of underscorejs
-add proper documentation
-make the css and html changeable after component is made
-optimize the functions
