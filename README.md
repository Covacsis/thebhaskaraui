# the bhaskara ui

The idea is to provide few simple UI tools.
Inspired by http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/ and angularjs v1

## MakeComponent

This can glue html and javascript seamlessly (like angularjs version 1) (need to check if it is really as good as angularjs)

Code is very small and simple.

For now see test.html for an example

### Advantages
1. It is very light weight compared to any standard view-model kind of libraries.
2. Handles many view-model glue scenarions.
3. Simple to use.
4. Helpful for component/modular/widget based development.
5. It is independent.

## Pending or ongoing activities
* make more required binders
* add proper documentation
* make the css and html changeable after component is made
* optimize the functions
